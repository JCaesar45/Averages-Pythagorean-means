# Call of Duty Themed Pythagorean Means Analysis Webpage

## Overview
This project is a sleek, modern, Call of Duty-inspired webpage demonstrating advanced JavaScript calculations and dynamic UI design. It computes the three Pythagorean means (Arithmetic, Geometric, and Harmonic) for a set of integers (1 to 10) and visually displays the results with a gaming aesthetic. Designed to impress companies and fellow developers, this project showcases proficiency in HTML, CSS, and modern JavaScript.

## Features
- **Dark, neon, Call of Duty-inspired design** for a gaming aesthetic.
- **Interactive button** to perform calculations dynamically.
- **Displays the three means** with precise formatting.
- **Validates** the inequality \(A \geq G \geq H\) and displays the result.
- **Responsive and clean layout** suitable for portfolio or interview presentations.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** for webpage structure.
- **CSS3** with custom styling for visual appeal.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** for advanced, modular scripting and calculations.
- **Google Fonts** for a futuristic, sci-fi font style.

## Setup & Usage
1. **Clone or download this repository** to your local machine.
2. Ensure the following files exist in the project directory:
   - `index.html`
   - `styles.css`
   - `script.js`
3. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.
4. Click the **"Calculate Means"** button to see the results dynamically generated.

## Customization
- You can modify the dataset by changing the array in the JavaScript file.
- Enhance the visual style by editing the CSS file.
- Extend functionality by adding animations or additional mathematical analyses.

## Demo
A live demo can be hosted using platforms like GitHub Pages or your local development environment.

## Example Output
When clicking the button, the results will look like:
``
Arithmetic Mean: 5.5
Geometric Mean: 4.53
Harmonic Mean: 3.41
is A >= G >= H ? yes
``
